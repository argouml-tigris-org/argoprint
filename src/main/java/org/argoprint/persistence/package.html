  <TITLE>The org.argoprint.persistence package</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
This package contains the persistence API for ArgoPrint.

The TemplateEngine provides a pluggable mechanism for supporting different
types of templating engines.  The TemplateEngineFactory uses the Java SPI mechanism
to "discover" all implementations of the TemplateEngine interface, and serves as a
registry for template engines.  TemplateEngine implementations are selectable (@see TemplateEngineFactory#getInstance based
on the file extension of the template.

The PostProcessor provides a pluggable mechanism for supporting different types
of post-templating operations.  For example, if the user selects an Open Office template
the PostProcessor will handle re-zipping the file.
