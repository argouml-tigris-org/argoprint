<h2>Description</h2>

<p>ArgoPrint is the result of a project of a course at
Link&ouml;ping Institute of Technology, Sweden. The initiative behind
this project is Linus Tolke, one of the main developers of ArgoUML.</p>

<p>During 2006 Ion Savin will rework ArgoPrint. He is participating
one of the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer of
Code</a> students working with ArgoUML. You can follow up on his progress on
<a href="soc2006">the summary page</a>.</p>

<p>In 2010 & 2011, the module was completely rewritten by Mark
Fortner to support pluggable templating engines (both Velocity and XSLT
are now supported), and the user interface was also rewritten. Default
templates were created for requirements and design documents. These
templates can be cloned and customized to suit individual needs.
Diagrams can be exported as either embedded base64 encoded images, or
embedded SVG images (examples of both are in the default templates).
More templates to follow.</p>

<h3>The Mission</h3>

<p>The aim of this project is to produce a module for ArgoUML that
can generate reports of the data contained in an ArgoUML project. The
module will read from a template that is written by the document author
in an XML-format defined by the project. The template defines the
content and format (for example DocBook) of the output document and
makes it possible to extract information from the ArgoUML model to be
included in the document. Eventually, the content could also come from
other tools.</p>

<p>The reason for doing this is that it will enable a completely
automatic way of generating the documentation for a project modeled in
ArgoUML and it will make it much easier to maintain the documentation
even when changes are made to the ArgoUML model. All you need to do to
keep the documentation up to date is to run the templates through
ArgoPrint and the changes will be reflected in the documents.</p>
