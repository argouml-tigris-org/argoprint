<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
ArgoPrint is the result of a project of a course at
Link&ouml;ping Institute of Technology, Sweden.
The initiative behind this project is Linus Tolke,
one of the main developers of ArgoUML.
</p>

<p>
During 2006 Ion Savin will rework ArgoPrint.
He is participating one of the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer of Code</a> students
working with ArgoUML.
You can follow up on his progress on 
<a href="soc2006">the summary page</a>.

<h3>The Mission</h3>

<p>
The aim of this project is to produce a module for ArgoUML that can
generate reports of the data contained in an ArgoUML project.

The module will read from a template that is written by the
document author in an XML-format defined by the project.

The template defines the content and format (for example DocBook) of
the output document and makes it possible to extract information from
the ArgoUML model to be included in the document.

Eventually, the content could also come from other tools.
</p>

<p>
The reason for doing this is that it will enable a completely
automatic way of generating the documentation for a project modeled
in ArgoUML and it will make it much easier to maintain the
documentation even when changes are made to the ArgoUML model.

All you need to do to keep the documentation up to date is to run the
templates through ArgoPrint and the changes will be reflected in the
documents.
