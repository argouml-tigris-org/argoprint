<p> In order to test ArgoPrint you should check-out the repositories for 
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectSource#cmdlinecvs">ArgoUML</a> and
<a href="http://argoprint.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectSource#cmdlinesvn">ArgoPrint</a>
in the same directory and and build ArgoPrint using the "install" target. To build
and run ArgoUML you can build using the "run" target. ArgoPrint should be available
in the "Tools" menu of ArgoUML.
</p>

<h2>Manager usage</h2>
<p> The blank row in the Manager table is the "edit row". It's content is not used
when the "Generate" function is called. When all fields of the "edit row" are filled
with valid data a new row is appended to the table and the "edit row" is cleared and
can be used to add additional templates.</p>

<p> The data in the table is saved between two runs of ArgoUML.</p>

<p> In order to generate output using the current project inside ArgoUML fill in the
templates that you want to use and the files in which you want the output
to be stored and hit the "Generate" button.</p>

<p> You can select the templates that you want/don't want to be generated by using
the check box available on each row (checked means that it will be generated)</p>

<p> Parameters can be transmited to each template and are available using the
standard XSLT parameter mechanism inside the template. The parameter table uses
an edit row similar to the one in the manager table.</p>

<p> By right-clicking on the rows of the table you will get a context menu from
which you can remove nodes and, for the manager table, get file choosers for the
template and output files.
