<h1>Activity Log</h1>

<p>
This is Ion's activity log for the SoC work on ArgoPrint.
</p>

<p><b>21/06/02</b> Work on the CellEditor/Renderer. Considered the posibility
of implementing a system similar to ArgoUML critics for the ArgoPrint editor.
Still couldn't solve the issue with the access to the resources.

<p><b>20/06/02</b> The editor has now basic functionality: tree representation
of XML content, new/save/load functions implemented, basic tree manipulation 
(adding nodes/removing subtrees). I've experimented with various custom CellEditors
and CellRenderers that will be used as interface for altering the content of the
tree. Still haven't figured out how to access resources (icons and resource bundles)
that are located inside the same jar as the module (looked at dev@argouml archives
and the cookbook; will look at the argouml source code in the morning). I will
commit the changes after I obtain a satisfying result with the Renderers/Editors and
after I add the license/copyright headers.

<p><b>-19/06/06</b> XMI/XSLT evaluation, looked at other XML/XSLT editors,
coding for the editor - custom widgets, basic GUI framework
</p>

<p><b>11/06/06</b> Looked at the XMI-related material in the dev archive,
cookbook and the relation between versions of XMI and UML. Looking to see if
making ArgoPrint work with XMI 2.1 (corresponds to UML 2.0) and providing
a transformation from XMI 1.2 to XMI 2.1 would not create problems hence
solving the problem of having to modify ArgoPrint when UML 2.0 will be used.
Tried to figure out a way of using reflection with XSLT but nothing seems
to work in that direction. Considered a candidate standard XML DTD to be used
to specify data-sources and output for ArgoPrint.</p>

<p><b>10/06/06</b> Re-done Chapter 3 of XSLT evaluation based on
the remarks made by Linus.</p>

<p><b>09/06/06</b> Looked at the GUI implementation of ArgoUML, drafted
some requirements for the ArgoPrint dialog and done an interface prototype.</p> 

<p><b>08/06/06</b> School stuff. No more school from now on.</p>

<p><b>07/06/06</b> School stuff.</p>

<p><b>06/06/06</b> School stuff.</p>

<p><b>05/06/06</b> JET evaluation. SoC-related papers.</p>

<p><b>04/06/06</b> XSLT Evaluation, learning ANT, cookbook+code exploration</p>

<p><b>03/06/06</b> Another distraction is over, finished the SCJP training.</p>

<p><b>02/06/06</b> Velocity Evaluation</p>

<p>
<b>29/05/06</b> Read JET tutorials. Set up the Eclipse to work with
JET and made some tests. Read parts of the CookBook and had a look
at the project's code.

<p>
<b>28/05/06</b> Read parts from "DocBook: The Definitive Guide",
ArgoUML Cookbook, Velocity Developer's Guide.
</p>

<p>
<b>27/05/06</b>
Read Velocity User Guide at [1]. The language seems to
have the same problems like StringTemplate. A unified model is
required for multiple data sources and sorting and filtering have to
be backed up with specific code in the model.

<b>26/05/06</b>
Read the StringTemplate 2.2 documentation [1] and Terence Parr's
article on MVC separation [2] and installed the library and made some
simple tests. The implementation is nice (a couple of Smalltalk-like
constructs) but it does not allow fitering, sorting and multiple data
sources from within the template (violation of functional requirements
F-3.2, F-3.3). I could not find an editor to know about StringTemplate
([3] is a relatively recent thread supporting this).
