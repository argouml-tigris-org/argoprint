Read Velocity User Guide at [1]. The language seems to
have the same problems like StringTemplate. A unified model is
required for multiple data sources and sorting and filtering have to
be backed up with specific code.

Read the StringTemplate 2.2 documentation [1] and Terence Parr's
article on MVC separation [2] and installed the library and made some
simple tests. The implementation is nice (a couple of Smalltalk-like
constructs) but it does not allow fitering, sorting and multiple data
sources from within the template (violation of functional requirements
F-3.2, F-3.3). I could not find an editor to know about StringTemplate
([3] is a relatively recent thread supporting this).
