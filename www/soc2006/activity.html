<p><b>10/06/06</b>Re-done Chapter 3 of XSLT evaluation based on
the remarks made by Linus.</p>

<p><b>09/06/06</b>Looked at the GUI implementation of ArgoUML, drafted
some requirements for the ArgoPrint dialog and done an interface prototype.</p> 

<p><b>08/06/06</b>School stuff. No more school from now on.</p>

<p><b>07/06/06</b>School stuff.</p>

<p><b>06/06/06</b>School stuff.</p>

<p><b>05/06/06</b>JET evaluation. SoC-related papers.</p>

<p><b>03/06/06</b>Another distraction is over, finished the SCJP training.</p>

<p><b>02/06/06</b>Velocity Evaluation</p>

<p>
<b>29/05/06</b> Read JET tutorials. Set up the Eclipse to work with
JET and made some tests. Read parts of the CookBook and had a look
at the project's code.

ArgoUML Cookbook, Velocity Developer's Guide.

<b>27/05/06</b>
Read Velocity User Guide at [1]. The language seems to
have the same problems like StringTemplate. A unified model is
required for multiple data sources and sorting and filtering have to
be backed up with specific code in the model.

<b>26/05/06</b>
Read the StringTemplate 2.2 documentation [1] and Terence Parr's
article on MVC separation [2] and installed the library and made some
simple tests. The implementation is nice (a couple of Smalltalk-like
constructs) but it does not allow fitering, sorting and multiple data
sources from within the template (violation of functional requirements
F-3.2, F-3.3). I could not find an editor to know about StringTemplate
([3] is a relatively recent thread supporting this).
