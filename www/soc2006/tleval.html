<h1>Template Language Evaluation</h1>

<p>
This is Linus' idea on how to conduct the template language evaluation.
</p>

<p>
This is an evaluation of the template language.
For that reason we can assume that all trivial access methods
exists and have the obvious names (the same names all the time).
We don't have any complex access methods meaning that the
template language should take care of all the control, selection,
and comparison.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>For each template language, create a template that creates either
      html or docbook or both that
    <ul>
      <li>Shows a subset of classes based on the name of the containing
          package in chapter 1.
      <li>For each of these classes,
          shows all the names and types of the attributes.
          For those classes that doesn't have attributes include instead
          the text "No attributes."

      <li>Shows a subset of classes based on the name of one of
          the stereotypes in chapter 2.
      <li>For each of these classes,
          shows the signature of all the operations including
	  return value,
          direction, name, and type of each parameter.
          Each method as a bullet in a bulleted list.

      <li>Show a subset of classes based on the existance of a parameter
          named "something" in any of the operations in the class in chapter 3.
      <li>For each of these classes,
          if they contain operations other than the one named "something",
          show these in a table with one operation on each line with 
          the operation name in the first column and then one column per
          distinct type for all parameters with the names of the parameters
	  filled in the table.
	  For those classes that doesn't have any other operations,
          include instead the text "No other operations."

      <li>Show all use case diagrams in chapter 4
      <li>Under each use case diagram, a list of actors and a list of use cases
          both with their explanations.
	  
      <li>Show the use cases that are linked to
          a requirement (requirements fetched from some other tool than
	  argouml indexed on the use case names) in chapter 5.
      <li>Under each use case, show the requirement text.
    </ul>

  <li>Create a template that creates a html site with two frames.
      One tree on the left with all actors, use cases, classes, attributes,
      operations,
      and then one page per actor, class, use case.

  <li>Compare these templates with the following criteria
    <ul>
      <li>Length
      <li>Complexity (i.e. how complex control structures were needed
          to achieve this).
      <li>How error prone they are
      <li>How easy it is to spot and fix an error in them.
    </ul>

  <li>Check what editors are available with that template engine,
      its license and extendability.
      How well do the editor help in error spotting and fixing,
      handling the length and complexity.
</ol>
